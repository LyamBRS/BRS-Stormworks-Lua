# BRS Stormwork Lua

## Information

### What is this repository?
I've made a lot of Lua stuff in my 6k hours and 5 years of playtime on Stormworks. However, I've been pushing and procrastinating since forever ago the idea of a public GitHub repository that contains all of my Lua scripts and projects in their unminified form, as well as the tools and functions I've made over the years.

A lot of this code won't be the best looking, efficient or structured. Some of these projects date back to 2020 and had the character limit of 4096.

The goal is to eventually be able to generate full Lua script from imports of global variables and functions and no longer require copy pasting or complete redos when I start new projects.

### Disclamer
#### Using the contents of this repository
Feel free to use anything from this repository. I'd appreciate it if you mention where you took the Lua scripts or functions, but it's not required. The important thing in life is that you don't claim as your own what you take.
#### AI
Some of this code was probably written by AI at some point. After all it writes texts faster than I can type it by hands so why shouldn't I use it?
