# Projects

This folder contains all the Lua scripts I've made for all my projects that I can be bothered to transfer over. Some will be monolithic files and others will probably try Lua import methods and builder scripts to make the code more bearable.

From the date of the commit of this file, all my Lua scripts will be included in this folder, per project, or per microcontroller.
