-- [BRS] - [[ Information ]] --
-- `25/08/05`
-- ### Description
-- A BRIO array that must be given along to BRIO functions.
-- This one is for the slave side of the controller. Which means it only listens to the BUS input.
-- ### Used for
-- Contains the stages and their steps.
-- Contains the currently seen BRIO input.
-- Also tells if a command was executed or not, so another can be ready.
-- Also contains the awaiting ticks to avoid getting stuck in transmissions that can't end.
-- ### Held data
-- ```json
-- {
--  0, // Command stage.
--  0, // Command's step.
--  false, // Ongoing command. false if none. Holds what set of BRIO commands is being executed.
--  0, // BRIO number seen on the bus entry
--  0, // BRIO number to output. There solely for the simplicity of master and slave being identical.
--  0, // Await (as per constants)
--  0, // Executed address.
-- }
-- ```
