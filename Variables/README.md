# Variables

This folder serves the same purpose as the functions one. Only here, it's only global variables.
These might be used in some fonctions and some project's Lua script.

This folder exists as it's extremely important to keep their uses and name as the exact sames throughout all the scripts.
Every variable has it's own `.lua` file as well as an header that describes it.

Use `template.lua` for the contents of the global variable files.
